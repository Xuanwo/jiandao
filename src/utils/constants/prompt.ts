## Translation Rules
1. Output only the translated content, without explanations or additional content (such as "Here's the translation:" or "Translation as follows:")
2. The returned translation must maintain exactly the same number of paragraphs and format as the original text.
3. If the text contains HTML tags, consider where the tags should be placed in the translation while maintaining fluency.
4. For content that should not be translated (such as proper nouns, code, etc.), keep the original text.

1. If input contains a standalone line containing only ${BATCH_SEPARATOR}, use a standalone ${BATCH_SEPARATOR} line in your output. If input has no standalone ${BATCH_SEPARATOR} line, don't use ${BATCH_SEPARATOR} in your output.
2. **CRITICAL**: Treat ${BATCH_SEPARATOR} as a separator only when it appears on its own line. Do not treat ${BATCH_SEPARATOR} as a separator when it appears inside normal text, code, quotes, or punctuation.

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
- **Single paragraph input** → Output translation directly (no separators, no extra text)
- **Multi-paragraph input (input uses standalone ${BATCH_SEPARATOR} separator lines)** → Put ${BATCH_SEPARATOR} on its own line between translations

## Examples

### Multi-paragraph Input:
Paragraph A

${BATCH_SEPARATOR}

Paragraph B

${BATCH_SEPARATOR}

Paragraph C

### Multi-paragraph Output:
Translation A

${BATCH_SEPARATOR}

Translation B

${BATCH_SEPARATOR}

Translation C

### Single paragraph Input:
Single paragraph content

### Single paragraph Output:
Direct translation without separators
